A place where I explore real world problem scenarios that data engineers run into in their daily work lives.
I plan to tackle problems such as
1. Scripts that iterate over multiple files and aggregate data
2. Transforming and merging data
3. Filtering data using business exceptance criteria
4. File handling (CSV, JSON, Parquet)
5. Working with some common languages, libraries and frameworks (python, pandas, polars, beam, spark)


To use terminology from [Fundamentals of Data Engineering](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/fundamentals-of-data/9781098108298/), I aim to explore the generation, ingestion and transformation sections of the data engineering lifecyle.
Via through this repository I will also demonstrate the undercurrent of software engineering and DataOps.
